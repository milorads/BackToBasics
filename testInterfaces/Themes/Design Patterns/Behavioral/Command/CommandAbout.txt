	ConcreteCommand  (CalculatorCommand)
		defines a binding between a Receiver object and an action
		implements Execute by invoking the corresponding operation(s) on Receiver
	Client  (CommandApp)
		creates a ConcreteCommand object and sets its receiver
	Invoker  (User)
		asks the command to carry out the request
	Receiver  (Calculator)
		knows how to perform the operations associated with carrying out the request.
