The classes and objects participating in this pattern are:

	Handler   (Approver)
		defines an interface for handling the requests
		(optional) implements the successor link
	ConcreteHandler   (Director, VicePresident, President)
		handles requests it is responsible for
		can access its successor
		if the ConcreteHandler can handle the request, it does so; otherwise it forwards the request to its successor
	Client   (ChainApp)
		initiates the request to a ConcreteHandler object on the chain
