The classes and objects participating in this pattern are:

Facade   (MortgageApplication)
	knows which subsystem classes are responsible for a request.
	delegates client requests to appropriate subsystem objects.
Subsystem classes   (Bank, Credit, Loan)
	implement subsystem functionality.
	handle work assigned by the Facade object.
	have no knowledge of the facade and keep no reference to it.
