The classes and objects participating in this pattern are:

	AbstractClass  (DataObject)
		defines abstract primitive operations that concrete subclasses define to implement steps of an algorithm
		implements a template method defining the skeleton of an algorithm. The template method calls primitive operations as well as operations defined in AbstractClass or those of other objects.
	ConcreteClass  (CustomerDataObject)
		implements the primitive operations ot carry out subclass-specific steps of the algorithm
