# Back To Basics Series

After working with design pattens in this project I found out that it will go way out of scope, so it is a good way to have all the basics about software engineering in one place. When reading adn searching around web i found the following grouping was good to have things separated:

*Sorting algorithms
*Searching algorithms
*Data structures
*Design Patterns
*Paradigms
*Complexity Theory

This project is based on following books and websites (please note that some of the books are for Java but that is just because they are more available in my area and in the end, principles and concepts are what counts):
